I am a Economics Ph.D candidate at the Bonn Graduate School of Economics, graduating in Spring 2023 (:tada:). 
 
I have 4+ years of experience in empirical research, with practical application of  statistical analysis and data visualization in python. 

As a data scientist, I have strong theoretical background in econometrics, statistics and mathematics and have started on the journey of becoming a machine learning engineer.

As a software engineer, I have come to enjoy few things as much as writing clean, testable and well documented code! 

I can't share all of my research code here, but you can track my contributions to open source projects and gauge the level of my skills in the following python packages:

- Pandas
- Numpy, Numba, Scipy
- Matplotlib, Plotly
